This Website is specially dedicated to the Editorial Cds group for giving informations about every happenings in Nysc  saki-west LGA Zone Oyo state 


## Description
As a beginner in web development frontend precisely, i developed passion for creating websites and for event coverage so i decided to create this basic website for my community Devlopment Service (Editorial) group as a corp member with the collaboration of my Team member [youngenius](https://github.io/youngenius)

## Technnologies 
Basically the tools i used for the frontend job are:
* HTML5, CSS3, SASS &  JAVASCRIPT..

While fore the Backend my colleagues Used.
* Node js , Express & Postgress..

## Project Setup
This project assumes you have [NodeJS v8](http://nodejs.org/) or greater installed. 

You should also have [npm v5](https://www.npmjs.com/) or greater installed as well (this comes packaged
with Node 8). 

You'll also need a recent version of [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed
as well.

Also, you have to install [postgress]() so that you can access database.

[Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repo
[Clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) your fork
In the directory you cloned the repository, run `git fetch --all`


## Getting Started
These steps will assume that you have `cd`  in your preferred editor to this repositories cloned location.

1. Install dependencies: `npm install` 

2. Ensure you have installed the postgress app  While setting up the app choose your password 

3. After that process navigate to the ` config.js` in the project folder  and change the  password to the one you just created on  the database  e.g 
`db: {  host: "localhost",  database: "postgres", password: "enter the password here" }` 
        
NB: This the is development Mode...

4. After that open the Postgress `sql` command enter the created password .

5. Then open your command line and run `npm run server`  which will open the server `localhost 8080`.. 

6. Inorder to watch the sass if changes are  made open another command  line and run  `npm build-css` 

nb: ensure you are currently in the project directory...
     

## RoadMap 
As i progress on my learning path i will improve this website by re-building it entirely using a javascript framework  #react
